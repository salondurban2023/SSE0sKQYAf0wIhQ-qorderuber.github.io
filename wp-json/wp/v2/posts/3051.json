As we mentioned before, there&#8217;s no need to worry about touch-ups or re-applications &#8211; once it&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So whether you&#8217;re a busy mom or an avid athlete, you&#8217;ll be able to enjoy beautiful, effortless eyeliner day after day.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-reduced-spending-on-eye-makeups\">Reduced Spending on Eye Makeups<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Makeups are expensive and buying a new one every few months can really add up. But with permanent eyeliner, you can save a lot of money in the long run. Once your initial investment has been made, you&#8217;ll never have to spend money on eyeliner again &#8211; unless you want to change your style.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Website-Before-After-1024-\u00d7-1024-px-40-1.svg\" alt=\"Winged permanent eyeliner top and bottom\" class=\"wp-image-3079\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-to-expect-when-getting-permanent-eyeliner\">What to Expect When Getting Permanent Eyeliner<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before starting, your technician will use a topical cream to numb your skin. Once the area is numb, they&#8217;ll work with you to choose a style and colour for your liner. Black is always a safe choice, but some salons also offer blue, green, and even purple. Once you&#8217;ve decided on a look, the technician will map out your liner design using a pencil. This step is important because it allows you to make amendments before the tattooing begins.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;re happy with the design, the technician will begin tattooing the liner onto your skin. The whole process usually takes about an hour or two, although this will vary depending on the size and complexity of your design.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the procedure is finished, your technician will perform an eye bath\u2014this helps remove any blood or ink accumulated during the tattooing process. They&#8217;ll also give you an aftercare guide with specific instructions on how to care for your new liner. It&#8217;s important to follow these instructions carefully in order to avoid infection and ensure proper healing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, getting <a href=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/procedures\/permanent-eyeliner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">permanent eyeliner<\/a> is a pretty straightforward process. You should be happy with your new look if you go to a reputable salon and follow all of the aftercare instructions.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Website-Before-After-1024-\u00d7-1024-px-39-1.svg\" alt=\"Feline permanent eyeliner top only\" class=\"wp-image-3081\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-aftercare-for-permanent-eyeliner\">Aftercare for Permanent Eyeliner<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The first few days after your procedure are the most important when it comes to caring for your new permanent eyeliner. During this time, you&#8217;ll need to keep your eyelids as clean as possible to promote healing and avoid infection.&nbsp;<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Gently wash your eyelids with a mild cleanser and lukewarm water twice a day, being careful not to scrub too hard or get soap in your eyes. You may also want to apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly, or any suggested to keep your skin moisturized.<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>After the initial healing period, you&#8217;ll still need to take care of your eyeliner to keep it looking its best. Be sure to cleanse your face every day, including around your eye area.&nbsp;<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>You should also avoid using products that contain harsh chemicals or fragrances, as these can irritate the skin around your eyes and cause premature fading of the colour.&nbsp;<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>When applying makeup, be gentle and use oil-free products that won&#8217;t pull at the delicate skin around your eyes.&nbsp;<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-faqs-on-permanent-eyeliner\">FAQs on Permanent Eyeliner<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How much does it cost?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of permanent eyeliner will vary depending on the salon you go to, the complexity of your design, and your location. However, in Cape Town, the average cost is R2000-R3500 per session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Long does an eyeliner tattoo last?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Semi-permanent eyeliner can last anywhere from 3 to 5 years, though this duration is contingent on numerous external factors such as age, lifestyle and skin type. Additionally, it is recommended that individuals have a colour boost every 18 months to maintain the initial results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do eyeliner tattoos hurt?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The level of discomfort associated with eyeliner tattoos is often described as mild to moderate. A topical numbing cream is applied to the area before the procedure begins to minimise any pain or discomfort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do I prepare for my appointment?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to cease the use of lash serums two weeks prior to your appointment. Should you wear lash extensions, remove them one week prior to your eyeliner appointment. <br>If you wear contact lenses, take your glasses\/spectacles with you to wear after your eyeliner appointment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is permanent eyeliner safe?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When performed by a reputable technician in a sterile environment, permanent eyeliner is considered safe. However, as with any tattooing procedure, there is always a risk of infection, allergic reaction, and scarring.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Website-Before-After-1024-\u00d7-1024-px-45-1.svg\" alt=\"Misty eyeliner top and bottom\" class=\"wp-image-3082\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Permanent eyeliner is a great way to save time and hassle when it comes to your daily makeup routine.
