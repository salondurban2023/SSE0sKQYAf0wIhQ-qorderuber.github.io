The first recorded use was in Egypt, where women would dye their eyebrows with henna to make them appear thicker and more defined.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1920s, a French artist named Etienne Wilson pioneered the use of permanent eyeliner. He used a technique called micro pigmentation, which involved implanting colour into the dermal layer of the skin using a needle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1970s, another French artist named Jean-Claude le Grand began experimenting with the use of tattoos to create permanent makeup. His techniques were eventually adopted by American artists, and permanent makeup became increasingly popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, permanent makeup is a commonly used procedure that has many benefits for both men and women.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/c480b9fe-1ef0-4d34-acab-40bcc1df099b.png\" alt=\"Lip Mapping &amp; Design before Lip Blush Procedure\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Lip Mapping &amp; Design before Lip Blush Procedure<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-how-long-does-each-procedure-take\">How Long Does Each Procedure Take?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The length of time it takes for each procedure will depend on the type of procedure you are having done. For example, if you are having your eyebrows permanently made up, the process will take about 90 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you are having a more extensive procedure such as lip colour or eyeliner, the process will take about two hours.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/748d72f6-8441-48f3-98d5-e5dd7cf05bdb.png\" alt=\"Comfortable, Aesthetically Pleasing &amp; Calming Environment at Blink Beauty Salon\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Comfortable, Aesthetically Pleasing &amp; Calming Environment at Blink Beauty Salon<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-how-long-does-it-last\">How Long Does It Last?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Permanent makeup can last for many years, but it is not permanent. The lifespan will depend on several factors, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Your age<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Your skin type<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; The location of the procedure<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; How well you take care of your skin<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, procedures will last for three to five years.

Numbing cream is always applied before procedures to reduce or eliminate discomfort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-are-there-side-effects\">Are There Side Effects?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are very few side effects, but as with any type of procedure, there is always a slight risk of infection. Procedures are safe when they are performed by a licensed and experienced Permanent Makeup Artist like the ladies we employ at Blink Aesthetic Centres.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-are-permanent-cosmetics-permanent\">Are permanent cosmetics permanent?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Procedures are not permanent but can last for many years. The lifespan of your procedure will depend on several factors, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Your age<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Your skin type<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>The location of the procedure<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Lifestyle factors, e.g. sun exposure, etc.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-how-are-permanent-cosmetic-procedures-done\">How are permanent cosmetic procedures done?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Permanent makeup is essentially cosmetic tattooing. A needle deposits pigment into the dermis, the second layer of skin. The needle punctures the skin about 50 times per second.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-colours-can-be-used\">What colours can be used?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A wide range of colours is available, and new shades are being created all the time.

Permanent makeup uses smaller needles than tattoos, and the pigment is only deposited into the upper layer of the skin. This makes it less invasive than tattoos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-can-permanent-makeup-be-removed\">Can Permanent Makeup Be Removed?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be removed, but the removal process is usually more difficult than the application procedure itself. If you are not happy with your Permanent Makeup Procedure, please speak to one of our aesthetic artists about your options for removal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-s-a-touch-up-and-when-do-i-need-one\">What&#8217;s a touch-up and when do I need one?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A touch-up is a procedure that is performed after the initial procedure has begun to fade. Permanent makeup consists of your initial appointment and your 6\/8 week touchup appointment. Maintenance touch-ups are typically needed every three to five years, but this will depend on several factors, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Your age<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Your skin type<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Where you have it applied<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Lifestyle factors<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/5KVZ6337_ptg-f-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Permanent Brow Mapping &amp; Design\" class=\"wp-image-3185\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/5KVZ6337_ptg-f-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/5KVZ6337_ptg-f-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/5KVZ6337_ptg-f-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/5KVZ6337_ptg-f-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/5KVZ6337_ptg-f-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/5KVZ6337_ptg-f-scaled.jpg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Permanent Brow Mapping &amp; Design<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-are-the-different-types-of-procedures\">What are the Different Types of Procedures?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Permanent Lip Color<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Permanent Eyebrow Enhancement<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Permanent Eyeliner<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Areola Restoration<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Scar Camouflage<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Lip Neutralization<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Scalp Micropigmentation<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Website-Before-After-1024-\u00d7-1024-px-16-1.svg\" alt=\"Permanent Brows Before &amp; After\" class=\"wp-image-3147\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Website-Before-After-1024-\u00d7-1024-px-26-1.svg\" alt=\"Lip Blush (Lip Tattoo) Before &amp; After\" class=\"wp-image-3112\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Website-Before-After-1024-\u00d7-1024-px-25-1.svg\" alt=\"Lip Neutralization Before &amp; After\" class=\"wp-image-3111\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Website-Before-After-1024-\u00d7-1024-px-38.svg\" alt=\"Blink Permanent Eyeliner\" class=\"wp-image-3186\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This can save you time and money while giving you the appearance of perfectly applied makeup every day!
