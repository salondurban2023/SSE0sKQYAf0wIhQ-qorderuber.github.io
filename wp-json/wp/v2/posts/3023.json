Laser hair removal has become increasingly popular in recent years as a way to get rid of unwanted hair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only does this treatment promise to be much more effective than traditional methods like shaving and waxing, but it can also be much less painful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re considering laser hair removal, it&#8217;s important to do your research and understand the potential risks involved. This guide will give you everything you need to know about laser hair removal, from how it works to what you can expect during and after treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-laser-hair-removal\">What Is Laser Hair Removal?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unwanted hair is a common problem that many people face, but with laser hair removal, you can get rid of it for good. It&#8217;s non-invasive, meaning no cuts are involved, which appeals to many people. Common areas chosen for this treatment are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Legs<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Bikini area<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Back<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Legs<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Underarms<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Upper lip<\/p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.surferseo.art\/45638183-b804-4c6d-824c-3f1e1f101bb1.jpeg\"><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-does-laser-hair-removal-work\">How does Laser Hair Removal work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Laser hair removal targets the pigment in the hair follicle with a laser. The heat from the laser destroys the follicle, which then retards future hair growth. Since dark hair contains more pigment, it absorbs more heat than lighter-coloured hair. The heat transferred from the hair to the follicles can damage or destroy them, preventing new growth. Most people need multiple laser treatments because individual follicles are in different stages of growth at any given time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people will need multiple treatments to see the desired results, as the laser can only target hairs in the active growth phase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-who-can-have-laser-hair-removal\">Who Can Have Laser Hair Removal?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people can have laser hair removal, but there are some exceptions. People with very dark skin may not be good candidates because the laser can cause burns. People with light hair may also not be good candidates because the laser targets pigment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pregnant women and nursing mothers should avoid laser hair removal as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-benefits-of-laser-hair-removal\">The Benefits of Laser Hair Removal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-long-lasting-results-than-other-methods-like-shaving-tweezing-and-waxing\">Long-Lasting Results than Other Methods Like Shaving, Tweezing, and Waxing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Laser hair removal treatments produce long-lasting results. Most patients only need 2-6 treatments spaced 4-8 weeks apart to see significant results. Compare that to other methods like shaving, which needs to be done daily, and waxing, which needs to be done every 2-4 weeks, and it is easy to see why laser hair removal is such a popular choice\/<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to mention, the results from laser hair removal last much longer than those from shaving and waxing. Most people only need to come in for a touch-up once a year or even less after completing their initial treatment regime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-precise\">Precise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Laser hair removal treatments are also much more precise than other methods like shaving and waxing. This is because the laser targets the hair follicle directly without damaging the surrounding skin. This means you can treat small areas like the upper lip with precision without worrying about accidentally harming the skin around it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-it-is-a-good-solution-for-both-men-and-women\">It Is a Good Solution for Both Men and Women<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Laser hair removal is a good solution for both men and women looking to get rid of unwanted body hair. In fact, this treatment is becoming increasingly popular with men as they look for ways to remove unwanted back hair and chest hair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Happy-Client-8.svg\" alt=\"Suitable for men and women\" class=\"wp-image-3118\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-safe-for-almost-all-skin-types\">Safe for Almost All Skin Types&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Laser hair removal is safe for all skin colors, including those with light or wheatish complexions. This treatment targets the pigment in the hair follicle without harming the surrounding skin.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Website-Before-After-1024-\u00d7-1024-px-65.svg\" alt=\"Hollywood Laser Hair Removal\" class=\"wp-image-2940\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-suitable-for-large-areas\">Suitable for Large Areas<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, laser hair removal is suitable for large areas like the back, legs, and arms. If you are looking for a way to quickly and effectively remove unwanted body hair from large areas, then laser hair removal may be the right treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-quick-treatments\">Quick Treatments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Laser hair removal treatments are very fast, which means you can save a lot of time that would otherwise be spent shaving or waxing. The length of each treatment depends on the size and location of the area, but most people report feeling only minor discomfort during their treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-reduced-risk-of-ingrown-hairs\">Reduced Risk of Ingrown Hairs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingrown hairs are a common problem, especially for people who shave frequently. But because laser hair removal permanently reduces hair growth, you won&#8217;t have to worry about ingrown hairs anymore. This can be a great relief for people who suffer from frequent or severe ingrown hairs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-permanent-hair-reduction\">Permanent Hair Reduction&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although laser hair removal doesn&#8217;t guarantee permanent hair removal, it does promise significant long-term reduction. Most people who undergo laser hair removal treatments notice a significant reduction in hair growth after just a few treatments. And the best part is, once you achieve desired results, maintenance treatments are usually only necessary once or twice a year!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-no-side-effects\">No Side Effects&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the great things about laser hair removal is that no major side effects are associated with the treatment. Some people may experience minor side effects like redness or swelling around the treatment area, but these side effects typically go away within a day or two. If you want to get rid of body hair without pain or using harsh chemicals, laser hair removal might be the solution for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You Will Save Time and Money in the Long Run<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though laser hair removal treatments may be more expensive than other hair removal methods upfront, you will save money in the long run. This is because you won&#8217;t have to keep buying razors, shaving cream, wax, or other hair removal products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-less-pain-during-treatment\">Less Pain during Treatment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Laser hair removal is also much less painful than other methods like waxing. This is because the laser targets the hair follicle directly without damaging the surrounding skin. This means you can treat small areas like the upper lip with precision without worrying about accidentally harming the skin around it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-prepare-for-laser-hair-removal\">How to Prepare for Laser Hair Removal?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Laser hair removal is more than a technique to remove facial hair or other unwanted hair. It&#8217;s a medical treatment that requires training and comes with inherent dangers. You should carefully investigate the qualifications of the physician or technician who will perform your laser hair removal before you undergo it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before undergoing laser hair removal, you should limit plucking, waxing, or electrolyzing for only six weeks. Because the laser specifically zeroes in on the roots of hairs, which are removed through waxing or plucking. If you wax or pluck too close to your appointment, the laser may not be able to target all of your hair follicles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For six weeks before and after your treatment, you should also avoid sun exposure. That&#8217;s because the laser targets dark pigment, so tanned skin may absorb too much heat from the laser and be injured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaving is allowed, however, because it doesn&#8217;t remove the hair from the root. In fact, it&#8217;s actually recommended that you shave the treatment area before your appointment. That way, the laser will be able to target the root more easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-to-expect-during-your-laser-hair-removal-appointment\">What to Expect During Your Laser Hair Removal Appointment?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you undergo a hair removal, your hair will be trimmed to a few millimetres above the skin&#8217;s surface. It is recommended to shave a day before your appointment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hand-held laser device is passed back and forth over the skin during the treatment. The device emits brief pulses of light absorbed by the pigment in the hair follicles. The light energy is changed into heat, which damages the hair follicles and prevents them from producing new hair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may feel stinging during the treatment, but it should only last for a few seconds. Some people compare it to the sensation of getting snapped with a rubber band.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the treatment, your skin may be red and swollen. You may also have some crusted areas where the hair was treated. These side effects typically go away within a few hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will likely need multiple treatments to achieve desired results. Depending on your skin type, hair type, and treatment area, you will need a varying number of treatments. Most people need at least four to six treatments spaced four to eight weeks apart.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Happy-Client-7.svg\" alt=\"Laser hair removal is painfree\" class=\"wp-image-3119\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-care-for-your-skin-after-a-laser-hair-removal-treatment\">How to Care For Your Skin after a Laser Hair Removal Treatment?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve just had a laser hair removal treatment, there are some important things you need to do to care for your skin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>After laser hair removal, your skin will probably be red and a little bit painful. This is perfectly normal. After your treatment, your technician will give you individualized instructions on how to take care of your skin.<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>In general, however, it is important to apply cool compresses and to avoid anything that could irritate your skin. This means avoiding hot showers, saunas, steam rooms, etc. You should also avoid sun exposure and tanning beds.&nbsp;<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>It is also important to apply prescription creams or other topical treatments as directed by your physician. These treatments will help soothe your skin and promote healing.<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Finally, be sure to protect your skin from the sun by applying sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. And don&#8217;t forget\u2014you should avoid lotions with fragrances, as these can also irritate your skin.&nbsp;<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-choose-a-provider-for-your-laser-hair-removal-treatment\">How to Choose a Provider for Your Laser Hair Removal Treatment?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Letting the laser loose on your body hair is a big decision. After all, you&#8217;re dealing with highly concentrated beams of light that are powerful enough to damage your skin. So it&#8217;s important to choose a provider who is experienced and reputable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-provider-experience\">Provider Experience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about it\u2014would you rather have your hair removed by someone who has done it a few times or does it every day? When it comes to laser hair removal, you want to choose a provider with plenty of experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for a provider who is a board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon. These providers have the training and experience necessary to perform laser hair removal safely and effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-type-of-laser-is-used\">What Type of Laser is Used?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as there are many different types of at-home laser hair removal devices, there are also various types of lasers used in professional cosmetic treatments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The laser used for your treatment will depend on your skin type and hair colour. For example, your provider may use an Nd:YAG laser if you have dark skin and light hair. This type of laser is safe for dark skin because it targets the pigment in the hair, not the pigment in the skin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, four multiple types of lasers are available at a provider&#8217;s office:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Alexandrite Laser<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Nd: YAG Laser<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>IPL<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Diode Laser<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-number-of-treatments\">Number of Treatments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is crucial to have realistic expectations when undergoing <a href=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/procedures\/laser-hair-removal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">laser hair removal treatment<\/a>. Your specialist should be honest with you about how many sessions will yield the best results; on average, it takes 6-8 visits. Keep in mind that during the first session, only 85-90% of follicles are targeted, so complete hair removal may not occur until after a few additional treatments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have an open and frank conversation with your provider to ensure that you&#8217;re on the same page regarding your goals for treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Website-Before-After-1024-\u00d7-1024-px-68.svg\" alt=\"Chin laser hair removal\" class=\"wp-image-2942\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-is-the-clinic-certified\">Is The Clinic Certified?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Laser hair removal is a medical procedure, so you want to be sure that the clinic you choose is certified. Certification ensures that the clinic meets certain safety standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you call to inquire about treatment, be sure to ask if the clinic is certified. If they are not, continue your search until you find a certified provider.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-cost-of-treatment\">Cost of Treatment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of laser hair removal treatment will vary depending on the size of the area being treated, the number of treatments required, and the type of laser used. In general, you can expect to pay R400-R2200 per session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that you will likely need multiple treatments to achieve the desired results, so be sure to ask your provider about the cost of a complete treatment plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-package-deals\">Package Deals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some clinics offer package deals on laser hair removal treatments. These deals can save you money in the long run, so be sure to ask about them when you call to inquire about treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Website-Before-After-1024-\u00d7-1024-px-69.svg\" alt=\"Underarm laser hair removal\" class=\"wp-image-2943\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-faqs-on-laser-hair-removing\">FAQs on Laser Hair Removing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How many sessions should you do for laser hair removal?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most clients receive two to six laser treatments before all their hair is gone. On average, the first treatment decreases hair growth by 10% to 25%. With each additional treatment, you will lose more hair until it starts growing back more slowly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How much does laser hair removal cost?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of laser hair removal depends on the size of the area being treated. For example, a small area like the upper lip may only cost R400 per session, while a large area like the back may cost R2200 per session. The number of treatments required will also affect the cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the possible side effects?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Side effects from laser hair removal treatments are usually minor. They can include redness, swelling, and blistering of the skin. In rare cases, more serious side effects can occur, such as burns or permanent skin color changes. You should always talk to your doctor about the potential risks and side effects of any treatment before you undergo it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is it better to shave or laser?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaving simply removes the hair from the skin&#8217;s surface. As a result, it won&#8217;t be long before it returns. The entire hair follicle is destroyed with laser hair removal, preventing hairs from growing back. Shaved hairs may begin to grow back within a day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is laser hair removal permanent after 10 sessions?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A destroyed hair follicle cannot be regenerated. However, some hair will grow back in the targeted region after people have been treated for hair removal. It is possible to treat the area again over time to lessen the number of hairs sprout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How many years will laser hair removal last?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Complete your laser hair removal sessions, and you won&#8217;t have to worry about pesky hair for 2-6 years. However, depending on how thick or fast your hair grows, you may need maintenance sessions 1-4 times a year to keep the area completely smooth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is laser hair removal always successful?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People with light skin and dark hair have the best results for laser hair removal. It is less effective in people with dark skin or light hair. However, new laser technologies are effective on all skin types. Be sure to ask your provider about the best option for you.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Happy-Client-6.svg\" alt=\"5 star treatment\" class=\"wp-image-3120\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ongoing facial hair removal can be a time-consuming and costly endeavour.
