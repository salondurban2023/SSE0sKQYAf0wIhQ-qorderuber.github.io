The extensions may be made from several materials, including mink, silk, synthetic, human or horsehair.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Happy-Client-9.svg\" alt=\"Natural beautiful lashes at Blink\" class=\"wp-image-3133\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Beautiful lashes at Blink<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-why-does-every-woman-need-to-try-eyelash-extensions\">Why Does Every Woman Need to Try Eyelash Extensions?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Extensions are a great way to enhance your natural beauty without putting in a lot of effort. There are many reasons why every woman should try eyelash extensions at least once in her life. From the boost in confidence to the ease of low maintenance, many advantages make this experience one woman should have. Here are 10 reasons why you need to try eyelash extensions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-confidence-and-style\">Confidence and Style<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best things about getting eyelash extensions is the boost in confidence that comes along with it. Many women feel more beautiful with longer lashes, and as a result, their self-esteem soars. In addition, when your lashes look great, you will feel better about yourself overall, which can also lead to improved style choices. Depending on the type of lash you choose, they can also add a bit of sass or glamour to your outfit, which can be fun too!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-you-can-go-without-makeup\">You Can Go Without Makeup<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are used to wearing mascara every day, this can be a game-changer for you. Now you can go without makeup altogether and still look fabulous! Of course, if you want to wear makeup, that\u2019s fine as well \u2013 your lashes will still look great even with an added coat of mascara.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-it-is-a-lavish-procedure\">It Is a Lavish Procedure<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is something very luxurious about getting your lashes done professionally. It\u2019s a special treat you can give yourself, whether it\u2019s for a special occasion or just because you deserve it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-you-ll-have-more-free-time\">You\u2019ll Have More Free Time<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are used to applying mascara every day, you know what a time-consuming process it can be. When you have lash extensions, all of that time is freed up for other things! You can sleep an extra 10 minutes in the morning or use that time to do something else that you enjoy \u2013 it\u2019s up to you!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-saves-time\">Saves Time<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to freeing up time in the morning routine, lash extensions also save time throughout the week because they require less maintenance than regular mascara does. With regular mascara, you usually need to touch up your mascara at some point during the day, but with lash extensions, they will always look perfect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-can-be-customized-to-suit-your-desired-look\">Can Be Customized to Suit Your Desired Look<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great thing about lash extensions is that they can be customized to suit your desired look. Whether you want a natural look or something more dramatic, a lash style exists for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-semi-permanent\">Semi-permanent<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lash extensions are semi-permanent, which means they will eventually fall out on their own (usually after 2-3 months). This is great news for those who like to change their look often because it means you don\u2019t have to commit long-term to any style.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-low-maintenance-and-easy-to-take-care-of\">Low Maintenance and Easy To Take Care Of<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lash extensions are very easy to take care of \u2013 all you need is gentle cleansing and avoiding rubbing your eyes excessively (which can cause them to fall out prematurely). Other than that, just let them grow out on their own and enjoy having fabulous-looking lashes 24\/7.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in getting eyelash extensions, contact Blink Aesthetic Clicnis today!

They will then apply for the extensions one by one to your natural lashes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are applied by first cleansing the eyelashes and then applying a bonding agent to the lash line. The eyelashes are then curled and trimmed to the desired length. Individual eyelashes are then attached to the natural eyelashes with a special adhesive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-pick-the-right-eyelash-extension\">How to Pick the Right Eyelash Extension?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearing lashes is a great way to enhance your eyes, but finding the perfect lash length, width, and curl can be tricky. If you&#8217;re not sure where to start, here&#8217;s a quick guide on how to pick the right eyelash length and style for your face.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-consider-your-natural-lash-length\">Consider Your Natural Lash Length&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first things you should consider when picking an eyelash style is your natural lash length. If you have shorter lashes, you may want to go for a fuller, longer style to really make your eyes pop. On the other hand, if you have longer lashes, you can get away with a shorter or more subtle style.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-check-your-eye-shape\">Check Your Eye Shape&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your eye shape is also important to consider when picking an eyelash style. For example, if you have hooded eyes, you&#8217;ll want to avoid long lashes that drag down the corners of your eyes. Instead, opt for shorter styles that open up your eyes. If you have almond-shaped eyes, on the other hand, you can pretty much rock any style of lashes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-look-for-the-right-glue\">Look For The Right Glue&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all glues are useful for all lash types\u2014some work better than others depending on your skin type and the type of lashes you use. If you have sensitive skin, use hypoallergenic glue that won&#8217;t irritate your skin. If you&#8217;re using mink or synthetic hair lashes, look for a glue that works explicitly with those materials. Waterproof glues are also available if you need something that will hold up against sweat and tears.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-take-a-look-at-the-length\">Take A Look At The Length&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to lash length, there are three main categories: short (6-9 mm), medium (10-13 mm), and long (14+ mm). How long you want your lashes to be is entirely up to personal preference\u2014it&#8217;s just important to remember that long lashes tend to be more high-maintenance than shorter styles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-choose-your-color\">Choose Your Color&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaving this one up to personal preference, you can choose a classic black lash or switch it up with something fun, like blue or green. If you want something a little more subtle, brown lashes are also an option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-different-types-of-eyelash-extensions-available-at-blink-beauty-salin\">The Different Types of Eyelash Extensions Available at Blink Beauty Salin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Blink Beauty Salon, we offer a variety of eyelash extension options to suit your desired look.

This includes showering, swimming, sweating, etc.<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Be gentle with your lashes. Avoid rubbing or touching them excessively, as this can cause them to fall out prematurely.<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Use oil-free makeup removers and cleansers around your eyes. Oils can break down the bond of the lash extension adhesive, causing them to fall out prematurely.<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Be careful when using eyelash curlers. Only use curlers that have a soft silicone pad, as metal curlers can damage the lash extensions.<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Schedule regular touch-ups every two to four weeks to maintain your lash extensions.<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>If you follow these simple tips, your eyelash extensions will last several weeks and continue looking great!<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-faqs-on-eyelash-extensions\">FAQs on Eyelash Extensions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How long do eyelash extensions last?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They usually last for about two to four weeks. However, this may vary depending on your natural lash cycle and how well you care for your lashes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain eyelash extensions, it is important to avoid rubbing or touching your eyes, as this can cause the lash extensions to fall out prematurely. It is also important to avoid using oil-based products around the eye area, as this can dissolve the bonding agent used to apply the eyelashes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How often do you need to get them done again for the best results?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should get <a href=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/procedures\/eyelash-extensions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">eyelash extensions<\/a> every two to three weeks to maintain the best results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for a way to enhance your eyelashes without having to put in a lot of effort, eyelash extensions may be the perfect solution for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s the difference between false eyelashes and lash extensions?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>False eyelashes are individual lashes that are applied to the eyelid with glue. They are typically worn for special occasions and then removed afterwards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lash extensions, on the other hand, are semi-permanent. They are applied individually to your natural lashes with a surgical-grade adhesive and can last for several weeks before they need to be replaced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Which is better, fake lashes or lash extensions?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no right or wrong answer to this question &#8211; it simply depends on your personal preference. Some people prefer false eyelashes because they are less expensive and easier to apply than lash extensions. Others prefer lash extensions because they are semi-permanent and give the appearance of longer, fuller lashes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re undecided, we recommend trying both false eyelashes and eyelash extensions to see which one you like better!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are lash extensions safer than false lashes?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, they are considered to be safer than false eyelashes. This is because they are applied individually to your natural lashes with a surgical-grade adhesive, which is less likely to cause irritation or allergic reactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>False eyelashes, on the other hand, are glued directly to your eyelid. This can cause irritation or even an allergic reaction if you have sensitive skin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s the best way to remove lash extensions?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to remove eyelash extensions is by visiting a professional technician. They will be able to safely and quickly remove your lash extensions without damaging your natural lashes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you try to remove them yourself, you run the risk of damaging your natural lashes or causing irritation to your eyes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do lash extensions ruin your natural lashes?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, lash extensions will not ruin your natural lashes. If applied and maintained properly, eyelash extensions can actually help to strengthen and condition your natural lashes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is important to note that if eyelash extensions are not applied or maintained properly, they can cause damage to your natural lashes. This is why it&#8217;s important only to get lash extensions from a reputable and experienced technician.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How much do lash extensions cost?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of lash extensions varies depending on the type of extension you choose, the length and thickness of your lashes, and the number of extensions you need. Generally, eyelash extensions range in price from R600 &#8211; R1 200 for new lashes. Fillers cost between RX and RY.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-are-eyelash-extensions-worth-it\">Are eyelash extensions worth it?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people who have eyelash extensions say they are definitely worth it! Eyelash extensions save you time and hassle by eliminating the need for mascara, giving you the appearance of longer, fuller lashes 24\/ hours a day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can eyelash extensions be permanent?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, eyelash extensions are not permanent. They typically last for about two to four weeks and then need to be replaced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is the difference between synthetic and human hair lash extensions?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Synthetic lash extensions are made from a plastic material, while human hair eyelash extensions are made from 100% real human hair. Synthetic lashes are the thickest and darkest type of lash extension available, while human hair lashes can be styled to<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Extensions are a great way to enhance your appearance and give you the appearance of longer, fuller lashes. They are semi-permanent and can last for several weeks before they need to be replaced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re considering this procedure, we recommend visiting a professional technician at Blink Aesthetic Centres.
