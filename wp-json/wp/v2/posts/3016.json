The device uses a small amount of argon gas to create an electrical arc. This arc produces plasma, which is a 4th-state of matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Plasma Pen is an FDA-approved and CE-approved device for fibroblast therapy, a treatment that uses collagen to promote new tissue growth.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/eee40835-23bb-4725-bd28-1a7e5ea1226d.png\" alt=\"Beautiful natural woman\" width=\"NaN\" height=\"NaN\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-does-a-plasma-pen-work\">How Does a Plasma Pen Work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The device uses an electrical current and transforms it into gaseous dinitrogen (N2). The gas is applied topically to the skin on the face (or other areas being treated). The abrasiveness works on a microscopic level with the epidermal layer of skin. Additionally, it heats up and activates deeper layers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mechanism by which a Plasma Pen works is known as fibroblasting. The term &#8220;blasting&#8221; might sound unpleasant or hazardous, but it&#8217;s actually named for fibroblasts, a kind of connective tissue cell common in your body. By stimulating collagen production, Plasma Pen treatment can fill wrinkles and tighten sagging skin, among other benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/0c58d652-5d94-462b-8827-84195780be86.png\" alt=\"Fibroblast, collagen &amp; elastin in your skin\" width=\"540\" height=\"540\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-a-plasma-pen-used-for\">What Is a Plasma Pen Used For?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the body ages, its dermal layers naturally thin and produce less collagen. This may lead to our external appearance becoming wrinkled or sagging. Plasma Pen treatment&#8217;s collagen-boosting properties make it an excellent choice for achieving a wide range of esthetic goals and treating various dermatological problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most frequent applications for Plasma Pen therapy are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Wrinkle and line reduction<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Skin lifting and tightening<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Pigmentation correction<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Circumferential reduction (thigh lift, arm lift)<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Stretch mark reduction<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Eyelid lift<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Non-surgical rhinoplasty (nose job)<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><p>Acne and chickenpox scar reduction<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Website-Before-After-1024-\u00d7-1024-px-48-2.svg\" alt=\"Plasma Pen - Eyes\" class=\"wp-image-2984\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Popular natural alternative for blepharoplasty<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-to-expect-before-during-and-after-a-plasma-pen-treatment\">What to Expect Before, During, and after a Plasma Pen Treatment?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-before-your-treatment\">Before Your Treatment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before your Plasma Pen treatment, you will meet with your aesthetician or doctor to discuss your goals for the treatment. They will evaluate your skin and make sure that you are a good candidate for the procedure.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to avoid sun exposure, and tanning before your treatment as this can increase your risk for complications. You should also avoid taking blood thinners such as aspirin or ibuprofen for at least a week before your treatment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-during-your-treatment\">During Your Treatment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During your Plasma Pen treatment, a small handpiece will be used to deliver plasma energy to the area being treated. You may feel a tingling or pinching sensation as the plasma energy is delivered to your skin. The entire treatment usually takes less than an hour.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-after-your-treatment\">After Your Treatment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After your Plasma Pen treatment, you may feel like you have been sunburned. This is normal and will go away within a few hours. You will also be given an aftercare kit that includes everything you need to care for your skin after the treatment. Be sure to follow all aftercare instructions carefully to minimize any side effects or complications.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should avoid sun exposure for at least two weeks after your treatment, as this can increase your risk for pigmentation changes. You should also avoid using makeup or skincare products that contain active ingredients such as retinol or glycolic acid for at least 24 hours after the treatment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4144801a-4dda-4ed4-9ddf-a5da52ef24d1-1024x852.png\" alt=\"Renew skin with plasma pen (skin firming treatment)\" class=\"wp-image-3003\" width=\"512\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4144801a-4dda-4ed4-9ddf-a5da52ef24d1-1024x852.png 1024w, https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4144801a-4dda-4ed4-9ddf-a5da52ef24d1-300x250.png 300w, https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4144801a-4dda-4ed4-9ddf-a5da52ef24d1-768x639.png 768w, https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4144801a-4dda-4ed4-9ddf-a5da52ef24d1-1536x1279.png 1536w, https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4144801a-4dda-4ed4-9ddf-a5da52ef24d1-2048x1705.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-are-the-benefits-of-using-a-plasma-pen\">What Are the Benefits of Using a Plasma Pen?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the latest technological advances, there are many ways to achieve many of the same aesthetic goals.

In most cases, you will only need one treatment to see a noticeable difference in your skin.

This is because they use your body&#8217;s own collagen to lift and tighten skin. This gives you results that look and feel natural, unlike fillers or surgery, which can sometimes give you an unnatural appearance.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Website-Before-After-1024-\u00d7-1024-px-49-3.svg\" alt=\"non surgical blepharoplasty\" class=\"wp-image-2985\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-minimal-side-effects\">Minimal Side Effects&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You may experience some redness, swelling, or bruising after the procedure, but this is usually temporary and will go away within a few days.

This can help you achieve a slimmer appearance without undergoing surgery or other invasive procedures.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/8389ed2d-6383-43a3-bc13-475ffa852d05-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Friendly staff\" class=\"wp-image-3004\" width=\"512\" height=\"342\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/8389ed2d-6383-43a3-bc13-475ffa852d05-1024x683.png 1024w, https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/8389ed2d-6383-43a3-bc13-475ffa852d05-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/8389ed2d-6383-43a3-bc13-475ffa852d05-768x512.png 768w, https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/8389ed2d-6383-43a3-bc13-475ffa852d05-1536x1024.png 1536w, https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/8389ed2d-6383-43a3-bc13-475ffa852d05-2048x1365.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-choose-the-right-plasma-pen-technician\">How to Choose the Right Plasma Pen Technician?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re considering a Plasma Pen treatment, you want to make sure you&#8217;re in good hands.

A good technician can adjust the settings on the pen to give you the best results possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-prepare-your-skin\">Prepare your skin<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before your treatment, cleanse your skin and remove any makeup or oils. This will help the pen glide over your skin more easily and prevent any irritation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-apply-numbing-cream\">Apply numbing cream<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re worried about pain, apply numbing cream to your skin before your treatment. You&#8217;ll still feel some discomfort, but it should be manageable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-don-t-skip-aftercare\">Don&#8217;t skip aftercare<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After your treatment, it&#8217;s important to follow your technician&#8217;s aftercare instructions. Unnecessary exposure to sunlight, picking at scabs, and using harsh products on your skin can lead to irritation and delay healing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-be-patient\">Be patient<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Plasma pen treatments can take some time to show results. In most cases, it takes multiple treatments spaced out over several weeks or months to see the full effects. So be patient and don&#8217;t expect miracles overnight.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blinkbeauty.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Website-Before-After-1024-\u00d7-1024-px-51-5.svg\" alt=\"Before &amp; After Plasma Pen Neck &amp; Chest\" class=\"wp-image-2986\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-faqs-on-plasma-pen-treatment\">FAQs on Plasma Pen Treatment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How much does the plasma pen treatment cost?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of the plasma pen treatment varies depending on the brand of pen used, the technician&#8217;s experience, and the treatment&#8217;s location.
